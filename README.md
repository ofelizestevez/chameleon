**Includes Customizable Links!** **This startpage uses cookies and browser local storage to save themes**

# Chameleon Startpage

Chameleon is my 2nd startpage developed. It is supposed to be a mixture of my work on [Just Another Terminal](https://github.com/ofelizestevez/Just-Another-Terminal) and a more traditional startpage.

**Have any suggestions or find any bugs? make an issue on this repo!**

## Current Features

* Randomly generated theme using pictures from Unsplash.
   * don't like the current theme? Click on the image on the lefthand side! **(Credit to u/Fxzzi for the idea)**
   * Uses Cookies and Localstorage to save themes (resets every 15 minutes).
* Time, Date, Weather
* A "command bar"
   * Google Search
   * Duckduckgo Search
   * Bing Search
   * Subreddit Navigation
   * Youtube Search
   * "Browse" aka a url bar
   * Twitch Search
* Command bar Suggestions + Autocompletion
   * **Currently only works for Subreddit**
   * **Click tab when the suggestion box pops up**
   * **Use the up and down arrow to browse through suggestions** 
   * Google used to work but without corsanywhere I have no idea how to achieve it.
   * Eventually I plan to do suggestions for every command bar option.
* Settings (currently incomplete)
   * **It does have an ability to add new sections and links!**

## Future Plans (Settings)
* Give ability to turn off time, date, weather, and/or the full status bar.
* Give ability to turn off which ever commands you don't use.
* Give ability to stop theme generation and stick with the current generated theme
* Give ability to create a theme
* Give ability to change font (probably just a google font though)

## Personal Notes

I've actually been working on this website for quite a while (Since october 2022). I have yet to fully release it because I haven't been satisfied with the settings page. **I'm just showing it off now to see if there's even a need to set up a settings page (aka to see if anyone likes it or wants to use it).**
